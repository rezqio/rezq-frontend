        <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>

        <p>
It is RezQ&#39;s policy to respect your privacy regarding any
      information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
      Policy applies to
          {' '}
          <a href="https://rezq.io/">https://rezq.io/</a>
          {' '}
      (hereinafter, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, or &quot;https://rezq.io/&quot;). We respect your privacy
      and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you
      may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
      (&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;) to explain what information may be collected on our
      Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
      disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies
      only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to
      our collection of information from other sources.
        </p>

        <p>
This Privacy Policy, together with the
          {' '}
          <a href="/terms">Terms and conditions</a>
          {' '}
posted on
      our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use
      of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website,
      you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>

        <p>
Like most website operators, RezQ collects non-personally-identifying
      information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
      available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
      and the date and time of each visitor request. RezQ&#39;s purpose in
      collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
      how RezQ&#39;s visitors use its website. From time to time, RezQ may
      release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
      publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        </p>

        <p>
RezQ also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. RezQ only discloses IP addresses under
      the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below.
        </p>

        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

        <p>
Certain visitors to RezQ&#39;s websites choose to interact with RezQ
      in ways that require RezQ to gather personally-identifying information.
      The amount and type of information that RezQ gathers depends on the
      nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at
      https://rezq.io/ to provide an email address.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>
The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
      remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
      electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
      acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
      guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>

        <p>
Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated
      by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that
      third party&#39;s site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
      and terms and conditions of every site you visit.
        </p>

        <p>
We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
      privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
      services.
        </p>

        <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

        <p>
RezQ discloses potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
      contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
      information in order to process it on RezQ&#39;s behalf or to provide
      services available at RezQ&#39;s website, and (ii) that have agreed not
      to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
      affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
      using RezQ&#39;s website, you consent to the transfer of such
      information to them. RezQ will not rent or sell potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
      Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
      described above, RezQ discloses potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
      order or other governmental request, or when RezQ believes in good faith
      that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
      of RezQ, third parties or the public at large.
        </p>

        <p>
If you are a registered user of https://rezq.io/ and have supplied
      your email address, RezQ may occasionally send you an email to tell you
      about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
      with what&#39;s going on with RezQ and our products. If you send us a
      request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
      mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
      clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
      RezQ takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
      unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
        </p>

        <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

        <p>
RezQ may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
      website. RezQ may display this information publicly or provide it to
      others. However, RezQ does not disclose your personally-identifying
      information.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>

        <p>
RezQ uses &quot;Cookies&quot; to store and communicate security tokens to
      prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This is for your
      protection.
        </p>

        <p>
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
      visitor&#39;s computer, and that the visitor&#39;s browser provides
      to the website each time the visitor returns. RezQ uses cookies to help
      RezQ identify and track visitors, their usage of https://rezq.io/, and
      their website access preferences. RezQ visitors who do not wish to have
      cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
      cookies before using RezQ&#39;s websites, with the drawback that
      certain features of RezQ&#39;s websites may not function properly
      without the aid of cookies.
        </p>

        <p>
By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie
      settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to RezQ&#39;s use of cookies.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

        <p>
Although most changes are likely to be minor, RezQ may change its
      Privacy Policy from time to time, and in RezQ&#39;s sole discretion.
      RezQ encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
      its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in
      this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
